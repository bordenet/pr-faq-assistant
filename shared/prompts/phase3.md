# Phase 3: Final Synthesis

You are creating the FINAL PR-FAQ document. Your target: score 80+ on the pr-faq-validator tool.

## SCORING CALIBRATION — THIS IS YOUR QUALITY BAR

**The pr-faq-validator scores harshly. Most documents score 50-65. You must beat that.**

**SCORE THRESHOLDS:**
- **Below 70**: Fails. Do not submit work that would score here.
- **70-74**: Passing but weak. Acceptable only if inputs were very limited.
- **75-79**: Good. This is your MINIMUM target.
- **80-85**: Strong. Would pass VP review. This is your GOAL.
- **86+**: Exceptional. Only if the review feedback was already positive.

**COMMON FAILURE MODES TO AVOID:**
1. Quotes without specific metrics (each quote needs %, $, hours, or ratios)
2. Quotes that all sound the same (vary structure, length, focus)
3. Fluff words anywhere (revolutionary, excited, seamless, comprehensive)
4. Vague headline (must have action verb + specific metric)
5. Missing 5 Ws in opening paragraph
6. Generic mechanism description ("uses AI" instead of specific how)

## YOUR TASK

**Synthesize the original and review into a document scoring 80+.**

### STEP 1: Address EVERY Critical Issue
Go through each issue in the review. For each one:
- If the review provided a fix, use it (or improve it)
- If the review identified a problem without a fix, solve it yourself

### STEP 2: Verify Against Rubric

**Structure & Hook (25 pts)**
- [ ] Headline: 8-15 words, action verb + MECHANISM + SPECIFIC metric
- [ ] Dateline: "CITY, ST — Month Day, Year —" exact format
- [ ] First paragraph: WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY + measurable outcome
- [ ] Customer pain described with empathy, then relief with specifics

**Content Quality (25 pts)**
- [ ] 5 Ws covered with SPECIFICS (company size, exact dates, target market)
- [ ] MECHANISM explained (HOW it works, not just WHAT it does)
- [ ] Competitive differentiation clear (why not use [Alternative]?)
- [ ] Price and Availability paragraph present

**Professional Tone (15 pts)**
- [ ] ZERO banned words: revolutionary, groundbreaking, cutting-edge, excited, thrilled, pleased, proud, seamless, comprehensive, robust, innovative, transformative, game-changing, passionate, delighted
- [ ] Active voice dominant
- [ ] Sentences under 25 words average
- [ ] No "we believe" or "we're excited" constructions

**Customer Evidence (10 pts)**
- [ ] Exactly 2 quotes (1 Executive Vision, 1 Customer Relief) — NOT 3-4
- [ ] EVERY quote has at least one quantitative metric
- [ ] NO emotional fluff in quotes (excited, love, thrilled, pleased, proud)
- [ ] Quotes sound like different people with different purposes

**FAQ Quality (25 pts) — THE "WORKING BACKWARDS" TEST**
- [ ] External FAQ: 5-7 questions, includes "How is this different from [Alternative]?"
- [ ] Internal FAQ: 5-7 questions with MANDATORY hard questions:
  - **Risk**: "What is the most likely reason this fails?"
  - **Reversibility**: "Is this a One-Way Door or Two-Way Door?"
  - **Opportunity Cost**: "What are we NOT doing if we build this?"
- [ ] Internal FAQ addresses unit economics / pricing logic
- [ ] NO "softball" questions (only easy wins with no hard truths)

### STEP 3: Self-Score Before Submitting

Before outputting, mentally score your document:
- Would a skeptical VP approve this for external release? If no, revise.
- Does every quote have a real number? If no, add them.
- Can you find ANY banned word? If yes, remove it.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

**Copy-Paste Ready Output Only**

<output_rules>
CRITICAL - Your final PR-FAQ must be copy-paste ready:
- Start IMMEDIATELY with the headline (no preamble like "Here's the final PR-FAQ...")
- End after the Internal FAQ (no sign-off like "Let me know if...")
- NO markdown code fences (```markdown) wrapping the output
- No commentary — Do NOT explain what you did or why
- The user will paste your ENTIRE response directly into the tool
</output_rules>
