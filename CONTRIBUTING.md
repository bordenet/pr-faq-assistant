# Contributing to PR-FAQ Assistant

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document outlines the standards and processes for contributing to this project.

---

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, professional, and constructive in all interactions.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/bordenet/pr-faq-assistant.git
cd pr-faq-assistant

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Start development server
npm run serve
```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `test/` - Test additions/changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

### 2. Make Changes

Follow the coding standards below.

### 3. Write Tests

All new code must include tests:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for user workflows

**Minimum coverage**: 85% for logic and branches

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Check coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### 5. Commit Changes

Use conventional commit format:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `test`: Tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `chore`: Maintenance

Example:
```
feat: Add export to PDF functionality

Implements PDF export using jsPDF library.
Includes unit tests and documentation.

Closes #123
```

### 6. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ES6+ features
- Use `const` and `let`, never `var`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Use template literals for strings
- Use async/await, not callbacks
- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Save a project to storage
 * @param {Object} project - Project object
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Saved project
 */
async function saveProject(project) {
  const validated = validateProject(project);
  return await storage.save(validated);
}
```

### Python

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Use docstrings for all functions
- Use f-strings for formatting

Example:
```python
def save_project(project: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Save a project to storage.
    
    Args:
        project: Project dictionary
        
    Returns:
        Saved project dictionary
    """
    validated = validate_project(project)
    return storage.save(validated)
```

### Go

- Follow Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for exported functions

Example:
```go
// SaveProject saves a project to storage
func SaveProject(project *Project) (*Project, error) {
    if err := validateProject(project); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return storage.Save(project)
}
```

## Documentation Standards

### Writing Style

**Avoid**:
- Hyperbolic language ("amazing", "revolutionary")
- Unsubstantiated claims ("production-grade", "enterprise-ready")
- Marketing speak
- Excessive exclamation marks

**Use**:
- Clear, factual statements
- Specific, measurable claims
- Professional tone
- Active voice

### Code Comments

- Explain **why**, not **what**
- Keep comments up-to-date
- Remove commented-out code
- Use TODO comments sparingly

Good:
```javascript
// Cache results to avoid expensive recalculation
const cached = cache.get(key);
```

Bad:
```javascript
// Get from cache
const cached = cache.get(key);
```

---

## Testing Standards

### Test Coverage

- Minimum 85% coverage for logic and branches
- Test all error cases
- Test edge cases
- Test browser compatibility

### Test Structure

```javascript
describe('Feature', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });

  it('should handle normal case', () => {
    // Test
  });

  it('should handle error case', () => {
    // Test
  });

  it('should handle edge case', () => {
    // Test
  });
});
```
